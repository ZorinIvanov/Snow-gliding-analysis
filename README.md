# Snow gliding analysis
**Topic name:** Influence of environmental factors on snow gliding prior and after first snowfall event

**Written by:** Zorin Ivanov

**Supervision:** Prof. Dr. Georg Leitinger (UIBK), Dr. Peter HÃ¶ller (UIBK, BFW)
## Description
Welcome to my project. As the title suggests, my aim was to idenfify the driving environmental factors for the process of snow gliding. The process is not well understood, hence forecasting of snow gliding and glide avalanches is still not possible. In order to build a reliable predictive model or an early-warning-system in the future, good-quality data, obtained over many measurement seasons, is needed. For this project, I was handled an extensive raw data obtained from two weather stations measuring environmental factors, as well as gliding data obtained from field loggers that detect very small movements in the snowpack. Here I showcase a part of the process of analyzing the dataset, as well as the statistical methods, techniques and tools I have used.

For the sake of simplicity, I don't follow the typical academic protocol. Instead, I showcase the project in two parts:

1. **Data cleaning and preparation of the master dataset.**
2. **Analysis and visualization.**
## Tools, Languages and Libraries Used
* R (dplyr, padr, data.table, ggplot2, scales, patchwork, lubridate, cowplot)
* SPSS
* MS Excel
