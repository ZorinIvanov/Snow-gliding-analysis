# Snow gliding analysis
Welcome to one of my projects called **"Influence of environmental factors on snow gliding prior and after first snowfall event"**. As the title suggests, my aim was to idenfify the driving environmental factors for the process of snow gliding. The process is not well understood, hence forecasting of snow gliding and glide avalanches is still not possible. In order to build a reliable predictive model or an early-warning-system, good-quality data, obtained over many measurement seasons, is needed. For this project, I was handled an extensive raw data obtained from two weather stations measuring environmental factors, as well as gliding data obtained from field loggers that detect very small movements in the snowpack.
